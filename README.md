# European-Roller-Coaster-Lineups
This repository contains code from an analysis I performed into the best European theme parks for roller coaster quality.

The code files above show various data visualisations of the dataset, and the Excel file contains the raw data.

The dataset with pivot tables showing insights can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_GaPx5r61Qlv7Irka92VrjFbQy-nhiJYRjeAOkNyDE8/edit?usp=sharing

The full analysis can be read in this forum thread: https://coasterforce.com/forums/threads/an-analysis-of-europe%E2%80%99s-coaster-selection-part-3-quantoverqual-and-qualoverquant.45455/
